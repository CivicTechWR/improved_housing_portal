# Improved housing portal

We want to make getting help and support for housing easy in Waterloo region.  Especially with the COVID-19 crisis, people are struggling with precarious housing situations. 

We have observed that some people are forced to stay in unsafe housing environments that might be mentally, physically, and/or emotionally abusive.

We are working to design an accessible resource where people in Waterloo region can get immediate help/support to leave their unsafe housing environment and into a safe shelter.
